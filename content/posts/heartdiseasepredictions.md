### Introduction
Heart disease is one of the deadliest disease patients face and early detection/prediction is key to achieving timely diagnosis and decision. The key to managing and detecting cardiovascular disease is to evaluate large scores of datasets, compare and mine for information that can be used to predict, prevent, manage and treat chronic diseases such as heart attacks.

Currently, there are a variety of machine learning algorithms that are popular and in use for predicting and performing various tasks. The aim is to compare 4 of the most popular and efficient algorithms on the same data set and evaluate how well they can make heart disease predictions or early detections.

The main goal of this project was to evaluate 4 machine learning algorithms by creating a learning model and evaluating how well they perform on the same data set.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a technology that gives computers the ability to learn from past experiences (or data), just like humans. From self-driving cars, to discovering planets — the applications of ML are immense. It uses computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases.

Machine learning uses a few types of techiques - Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-supervised, Clustering etc.

##### Supervised learning
As the name suggests needs a human to supervise and tell the computer what to be trained for. We feed the computer with training data containing various features, and we also tell it the right answer.

##### Unsupervised learning
We let the computer discover patterns on its own, and then choose the one that makes most sense.
