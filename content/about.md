Hi! I'm Tonye.

I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Software Engineering at Villanova University, nearby to Philadelphia, PA. I am keen on using my knowledge in software and technology to provide solutions to problems around the world. Especially problems in third world countries. I have professional experience working as a developer in front-end web development and Java development.
